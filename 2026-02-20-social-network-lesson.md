# What I Learned from The Social Network

Today, I watched *The Social Network*.  
At first, I thought it was just a movie about the backend story of Facebook.  
But it is more than that — it is a story about ambition, obsession, and the real cost of success.

## Lesson 1: Coding Is Not Just Writing Code
This movie showed me that coding is not about typing random lines of code.  
It is about solving real-life problems.  

Mark Zuckerberg did not just write code for fun; he was building something people needed.  
That is what real programming means — building solutions.

## Lesson 2: Talent vs Consistency
Mark is extremely talented and a super-fast learner.  
Sometimes I feel I am not as talented as him. But I realized something important — I can be consistent.  

Talent is powerful, but consistency can also create results.  
If I keep learning every day, I can improve step by step.

## Lesson 3: The Cost of Success
The movie also showed the dark side of success — broken friendships, isolation, and emotional struggles.  
Success is not always glamorous. It often comes with sacrifice.  

This made me think deeply about what I want and what I am willing to sacrifice.

## Conclusion: What I Will Do Now
After watching this movie, I decided:
- My first priority will be coding.
- I will build at least two simple projects per week.
- I will reduce my social media addiction and avoid wasting time.
- I will focus on developing real skills like English speaking and blogging.

I do not just want to watch people build successful companies. I want to build something meaningful myself.
