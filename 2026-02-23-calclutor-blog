##introduction 
AS a first-year student passionate about programming ,I recently build a web project using Html,css,javaScript.
Instead of just watching tutorials, I challenged myself to build somthings on my own.This project represens a small but miningful step in my journy 
tobward becoming a skilled developer.
## why i build this project
I wanted  to :
-strengthen my html fundamentals.
-Improve Css layout and designe skills.
-practice real javascrept logic 
-understand how frontend technologies connect together
I realized that just learning theory is not enough -building project is where real learning happends.
## Technologies Used 
-HTML5-for struccturing the webpage
-CSS-For styling and layout.
-javascrept(Vanilla js)-For interactivity and functionality
No frameworks, no libraries --just pure fundamentals.

##What I learned 
1-We-organized Html helps a lot when styling with css or adding javascript functionality.
2.Css is more powerfull than I thought 
I practiced:
-flexbox alidnment 
-Button styling 
-spacing and layout control
-basic responsiveness 
Designing the UI was actually fun,

3-JavaScript brings life to the project 
This is where things become exciting 
I worked with:
-document.querySelector()
-Event listeners 
-Functions
-Conditional logic
Understanding How user action trigger JavaScrept behavior gave me real confidance
##Challenges I faced 
-small syntex mistakes that broke everything 
-Debugging logic UI elements  with correct javascript functions
Sometime i feel stuck.
But debugging step by step taught me patience and problem-solving.
And honeastly ,Solving a bug feels amazing .
##what's next 
My next goals:
-Build more interactive project
-Improve UI/UX designe 
-Write a cleaner and more structured JavaScript
-start learning advanced concepts
My main focus is Consistency........
